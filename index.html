        <p><i>Interesting facts about chameleon</i></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Chameleons' eyesight has developed both to help them catch prey and, as we've seen, to help them escape predators. </li>
        <li>They can focus their eyes relatively well, meaning they can judge distances and spot prey between 5 and 10 metres. </li>
        <li>Chameleons also can see ultraviolet light, which isn't visible to humans.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about cicada</i></p>
        <ul>

        <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate. </li>
        <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>

        <li> Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes. </li>
        <li> Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
